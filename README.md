# Food Trends web application

This repository houses my final project for the Hackbright Academy curriculum.

__CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS__

## Overview
Food Trends is a web application that discovers popular ingredient pairings in 
the blogosphere. It is intended for food bloggers, writers, recipe developers, 
and foodies looking to tap into current food trends. Ideally, they could use 
this to guide content choice.

The core feature of this application:
1) Search for specific foods/ingredients -- then show ingredients frequently 
    paired with the search term.
2) Use D3.js to create a visual showing strength of pairings with term.

For example, if you searched "matcha", you would see that it frequently occurs 
with the term "tea" and "latte".
