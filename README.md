# Repository for Food Trends web application

This reposity houses my final project for the Hackbright Academy cirriculum.

## Overview
Food Trends is a web application that discovers popular ingredient pairings in 
the blogosphere. It is intended to be useful for food bloggers, writers, or 
recipe developers looking to tap into current food trends. Ideally, they could 
use this to guide content choice.

The core features of this application (MVP):
1) Search for specific foods/ingredients -- then show ingredients frequently 
    paired with the search term.
2) Dynamic visual showing strength of pairings with term.

For example, if you searched "matcha", you would see that it frequently occurs with the term "tea" and "latte".
