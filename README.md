# Food Trends web application

This repository houses my final project for the Hackbright Academy cirriculum.

__CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS__

## Overview
Food Trends is a web application that discovers popular ingredient pairings in 
the blogosphere. It is intended to be useful for food bloggers, writers, or 
recipe developers looking to tap into current food trends. Ideally, they could 
use this to guide content choice.

The core feature of this application (MVP):
1) Search for specific foods/ingredients -- then show ingredients frequently 
    paired with the search term.

For example, if you searched "matcha", you would see that it frequently occurs 
with the term "tea" and "latte".
